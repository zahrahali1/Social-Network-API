# Social Network API


##
In this task, I created an API for a social network web application using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete thoughts, along with the ability to react to thoughts posted by friends.

Due to time constraints, I was unable to fully debug the issues. As a result, when testing the API endpoints using Postman, errors persisted.

I acknowledge that the project is a work in progress and requires further debugging and refinement to achieve the desired functionality.
